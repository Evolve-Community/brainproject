##MediaPipe in C++
Building C++ command-line example apps
Option 1: Running on CPU
Option 2: Running on GPU
Please follow instructions below to build C++ command-line example apps in the supported MediaPipe solutions. To learn more about these example apps, start from Hello World! in C++.

Building C++ command-line example apps
Option 1: Running on CPU
To build, for example, MediaPipe Hands, run:

bazel build -c opt --define MEDIAPIPE_DISABLE_GPU=1 mediapipe/examples/desktop/hand_tracking:hand_tracking_cpu
To run the application:

GLOG_logtostderr=1 bazel-bin/mediapipe/examples/desktop/hand_tracking/hand_tracking_cpu \
  --calculator_graph_config_file=mediapipe/graphs/hand_tracking/hand_tracking_desktop_live.pbtxt
This will open up your webcam as long as it is connected and on. Any errors is likely due to your webcam being not accessible.

Option 2: Running on GPU
Note: This currently works only on Linux, and please first follow OpenGL ES Setup on Linux Desktop.

To build, for example, MediaPipe Hands, run:

bazel build -c opt --copt -DMESA_EGL_NO_X11_HEADERS --copt -DEGL_NO_X11 \
  mediapipe/examples/desktop/hand_tracking:hand_tracking_gpu
To run the application:

GLOG_logtostderr=1 bazel-bin/mediapipe/examples/desktop/hand_tracking/hand_tracking_gpu \
  --calculator_graph_config_file=mediapipe/graphs/hand_tracking/hand_tracking_mobile.pbtxt
This will open up your webcam as long as it is connected and on. Any errors is likely due to your webcam being not accessible, or GPU drivers not setup properly.
