    The 8 Core Cognitive Capacities
    Sustained Attention.
    Response Inhibition.
    Speed of Information Processing.
    Cognitive Flexibility.
    Multiple Simultaneous Attention.
    Working Memory.
    Category Formation.
    Pattern Recognition:
    {
      Models used:
      {
        On camera data: Computer vision models like resnet for image classification, segmentation, etc.
        Train models on On actuators value range (serial.read) logs and label based on context detection / mirror based approach: 
        { 
          Have camera input detect the movement being done and send it in real time to a common place where the configuration of each actuator is store in one raw with 
          all these values as parammeters + values from pose type detected of the huamnoid from the inverted image of the image being replicated using a mirror in front.
        }
      Feed Forward neural nets model based on values predicted from the models that are already trained and then using this value to in turn create more models.
  }
